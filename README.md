Bulding Better Diffs

Project Description
You've seen git diffs time and time again. They're often messy and take up way more space than you expected because you shifted some indentation or otherwise reformatted your file. These diffs work on files at a character-by-character level, meaning certain types of changes will always make a mess. Fundamentally, though, what you really care about is the difference in the actual code. In this project, we'd like to make a diff that doesn't care about the formatting of your code. Like how ostensibly HTML is for content and CSS is for presentation. Lots of languages already have automatic code formatters, but any reformatting still makes a mess in our diffs. We want to build a diff tool that only looks at the language syntax/tokens to get the core essence of the diff.
